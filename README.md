# Time-Bomb-With-Selector
This a more complicated version of the time-bomb program that I made.

Description: this is a bomb ( that detonates only acoustically and is very nervewracking) that I made on the 19-23/11/2019, when I was twelve years old.
 I made it by using Bodging, a technique I learned from youtuber Tom Scott. I first made the code for the buzzer, then the countdown and finally, the most tedious of them all, the "select time" part.
 It is not that useful but I think it's pretty cool.
Here is how it works:
                It starts by asking you to select the time that you want to countdown from using the potentiometer, value is in seconds.
                Then, you press the red button and the countdown starts.
                Once the countdown finishes, the "bomb" emits a very annoying sound that will wrack anyone's nerves.
NOTE: This NOT a weapon of mass destruction. 
      It is only used for mental destruction, if one wants to mess with another's nerves.
