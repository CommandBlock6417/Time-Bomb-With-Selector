# Time-Bomb-With-Selector

**This project is archived**

You can view the original code that I wrote in November 2019, at the age of twelve by browsing the [v1.0 tag archive](https://github.com/Devnol/Time-Bomb-With-Selector/releases/tag/v1.0). While it does work, it is fairly janky and hard to read. You can take a look at the new code in the [Time-Bomb](https://github.com/Devnol/Time-Bomb) repository.
